- issue_path: `docs/epics/workspace-routing-foundation/runtime-daemon-self-loop-followthrough-governance/issues/runtime-daemon-self-loop-followthrough-governance.md`

- verifier: `codex`

## Scope Verdict

- `PASS`: the blocker reproduced as a runtime/control-plane seam, not as a generic scan or task-selection defect.
- `PASS`: `project_has_authoritative_runtime_processes_for_user_precheck()` now requires supervisor truth instead of lone dispatcher/watchdog residue.
- `PASS`: daemon supervisor now ignores unexpected `TERM` without `stop.marker` and still records explicit daemon stop correctly.
- `PASS`: current manager continuity files that use `## Worker Delegation` now expose worker prompt paths to runtime launch and live-status truth.
- `PASS`: focused regressions and nearby daemon/live-status coverage passed on the guarded source lane.
- `PENDING`: the final protected-branch acceptance remains canonical `develop` self-host execution where Freely finishes one task to the current-project success standard, closes the worktree, and continues to the next task.

## Implementation Decision Note

- decision: `Keep the runtime fix narrow but extend continuity consumption so runtime can parse the current manager-written Worker Delegation handoff shape into launchable worker prompts.`
- why_this: `The new develop-side blocker was not scan selection itself; it was that manager continuity had already picked a worker lane but runtime treated the current continuity format as prompt-empty. Fixing that parser seam restores autonomy without adding a durable index or making scan heavier.`
- alternatives_considered: `Treat the unlaunched lane as a scan-selection failure; add a separate prompt lifecycle index; redesign live-status before fixing runtime continuity parsing.`
- boundary_non_goals: `No scan-architecture rewrite, no live-status redesign, no reduction in Freely's autonomous execution authority.`
- residual_risk: `The remaining risk is only the final canonical develop self-host acceptance, which still must prove end-to-end autonomous continuation after one completed task and lawful worktree retirement.`
