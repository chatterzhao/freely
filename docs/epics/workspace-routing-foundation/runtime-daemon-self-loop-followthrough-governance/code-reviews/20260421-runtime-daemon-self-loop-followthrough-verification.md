- issue_path: `docs/epics/workspace-routing-foundation/runtime-daemon-self-loop-followthrough-governance/issues/runtime-daemon-self-loop-followthrough-governance.md`

- verifier: `codex`

## Scope Verdict

- `PASS`: the blocker reproduced as a runtime/control-plane seam, not as a generic scan or task-selection defect.
- `PASS`: `project_has_authoritative_runtime_processes_for_user_precheck()` now requires supervisor truth instead of lone dispatcher/watchdog residue.
- `PASS`: daemon supervisor now ignores unexpected `TERM` without `stop.marker` and still records explicit daemon stop correctly.
- `PASS`: focused regressions and nearby daemon/live-status coverage passed on the guarded source lane.
- `PENDING`: the final protected-branch acceptance remains canonical `develop` self-host execution where Freely finishes one task to the current-project success standard, closes the worktree, and continues to the next task.

## Implementation Decision Note

- decision: `Fix the self-loop blocker in the runtime control plane with two bounded changes: authoritative-supervisor-only repeated-start refusal, and daemon unexpected-signal ignore unless stop.marker exists.`
- why_this: `Both changes map directly to observed runtime failures and preserve explicit stop semantics and Freely autonomy without widening the design surface.`
- alternatives_considered: `Treat watchdog/dispatcher as authoritative forever; redesign scan/live-status before fixing the runtime blocker; keep daemon TERM behavior unchanged and try to paper over it in higher loops.`
- boundary_non_goals: `No scan-architecture rewrite, no live-status redesign, no reduction in Freely's autonomous execution authority.`
- residual_risk: `The remaining risk is only the final canonical develop self-host acceptance, which still must prove end-to-end autonomous continuation after one completed task.`
